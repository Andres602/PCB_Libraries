PatternAgents PCB layout libraries and component footprints for various PCB layout Packages.
This library is updated frequently, always check for the latest version before generating your PCB's.
Also note that there are some experimental footprints in these libraries, and that you should
always verify your design against the actual component footprints before fabrication.

PatternAgents PCB layout libraries are organized differently than you may be used to;
we typically use manufacturer specific part numbers for our footprints.
The reason for this is that not all "cross-reference" parts are identical.
Organizing by (and ordering by) manufacturer specific part numbers will help
to insure that you get exactly the part you were expecting.
